NASH EQUILIBRIA:
Equilibrium 1:
  US Strategy: Cooperative Trade
  BRICS(India) Strategy: Accelerate De-dollarization
  US Payoff: $-0.8 trillion
  BRICS(India) Payoff: $0.8 trillion

DOMINANT STRATEGY ANALYSIS:
US Dominant Strategy: Cooperative Trade
BRICS(India) Dominant Strategy: Accelerate De-dollarization

DETAILED SCENARIO BREAKDOWN:

Us Aggressive Brics Accelerate:
  US Gains:
    Reduced BRICS imports: $0.125T
    Short term revenue: $0.030T
  US Losses:
    Lost dollar dominance: $-2.500T
    Lost defense market: $-0.150T
    Higher debt costs: $-0.800T
    Lost exports: $-0.083T
    Tariff retaliation: $-0.200T
 (India)  BRICS Gains:
    New currency benefits: $1.800T
    Defense market share: $0.150T
    Reduced US dependency: $0.500T
    Export diversification: $0.300T
(India)  BRICS Losses:
    Transition costs: $-0.250T

Us Cooperative Brics Maintain:
  US Gains:
    Maintain dollar dominance: $2.500T
    Stable exports: $0.083T
    Defense market preserved: $0.150T
    BRICS partnership: $0.200T
  US Losses:
    Trade deficit accepted: $-0.042T
 (India)  BRICS Gains:
    Stable trade: $0.500T
    US market access: $0.125T
    Technology transfer: $0.100T
(India)  BRICS Losses:
    Dollar dependency: $-0.125T
    Limited sovereignty: $-0.100T

STRATEGIC ANALYSIS:

Current Nash Equilibrium suggests that:
âš  SUB-OPTIMAL EQUILIBRIUM DETECTED
  Current path leads to mutual losses
  US risks losing dollar dominance ($2.5T annually)
  BRICS accelerates de-dollarization

POLICY IMPLICATIONS:
1. Aggressive tariffs trigger BRICS de-dollarization
2. Cooperative approach preserves US dollar dominance
3. Current Trump strategy appears to be Nash-dominated
4. Economic losses from tariff war exceed any trade benefits
